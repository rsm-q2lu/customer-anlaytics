    "Please complete this python notebook with your group by answering the questions in `intuit.pdf` on Canvas (week6/). Create a Notebook/HTML file with all your results and comments and push both the Rmarkdown and HTML file to GitLab when your team is done. All results MUST be reproducible (i.e., the TA and I must be able to recreate the HTML from the Jupyter Notebook file without changes or errors). This means that you should NOT use any python-packages that are not part of the rsm-msba-spark docker container.\n",

    "This is the first group assignment for MGTA 455 and you will be using git and GitLab. If two people edit the same file at the same time you could get what is called a \"merge conflict\". git will not decide for you who's change to accept so the team-lead will have to determine which edits to use. To avoid merge conflicts, **always** \"pull\" changes to the repo before you start working on any files. Then, when you are done, save and commit your changes, and then push them to GitLab. Make \"pull first\" a habit!\n",
